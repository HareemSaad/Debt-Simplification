# Debt-Simplification
Simplify debts (a.k.a. “debt simplification”) is a feature of Splitwise that restructures debt within groups of people. 
It does not change the total amount that anyone owes, but it makes it easier to pay people back by minimizing the total number of payments.

i have included three hard coded driver codes as exmaples

how to operate:
- enter number of participents taking part
- enter their names
- enter who owes money to whom
- the program will simplify debts and tell you who owes money to whom
